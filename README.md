# Two-Wheeler Loan Risk Assessment System

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive solution designed to assess the risk associated with two-wheeler loans, primarily targeting rural areas in India. The system evaluates loan applicants through a multi-stage process that incorporates demographic, financial, location-based, and psychometric data to generate an accurate risk score. The solution also utilizes advanced machine learning models to provide a detailed analysis of the risk factors.

## Key Features
1. **Demographic Risk Assessment**: Collects basic demographic details of applicants (age, income, occupation, etc.) and uses an **LGBM (LightGBM)** model to generate an initial risk score.
2. **Financial Evaluation**: Analyzes six months of bank transaction data using **Google Vertex AI** to provide a comprehensive financial score.
3. **Location-Based Risk**: Incorporates city-wise risk factors based on the applicant's geographic location to enhance the risk score.
4. **Psychometric Test**: Conducts a psychometric test to assess behavioral tendencies, which further contributes to the overall risk assessment.
5. **Analysis & Interpretation**: The **Ollama Model (3.1)** performs an in-depth analysis of the gathered data, providing interpretability and insight into the risk prediction process.

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collect basic demographic details such as age, income, occupation, and education level.
   - Gather six months of bank transaction records to analyze financial behavior.
   - Collect location-specific data for a city-wise risk assessment.
   - Conduct a psychometric test to gauge the applicant's behavioral tendencies.

2. **Risk Score Calculation**:
   - The **LGBM Model** processes demographic data and generates an initial risk score.
   - **Google Vertex AI** is used to analyze financial data and compute a comprehensive financial score.
   - A city-wise risk score is generated based on the applicant's location data.
   - A psychometric score is calculated based on the behavioral assessment from the psychometric test.

3. **Comprehensive Risk Score**:
   - The system combines the demographic, financial, location-based, and psychometric scores to generate an overall risk score.

4. **In-Depth Analysis**:
   - All collected data is sent to the **Ollama Model (3.1)**, which performs an advanced analysis to interpret the reasoning behind the risk prediction. This model ensures that the decision-making process is transparent and explainable.

## Technologies Used
- **LGBM (LightGBM)**: For calculating the initial demographic risk score.
- **Google Vertex AI**: For analyzing six months of bank transaction data and generating a financial score.
- **Ollama Model (3.1)**: For performing in-depth analysis and providing interpretability of the risk assessment.
- **Python**: For developing and integrating various models and processes.
- **Flask**: For building the backend APIs that interact with the models and handle the data flow.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- LightGBM
- Google Vertex AI API access
- Ollama Model 3.1 API or equivalent LLaMA model integration
- Pandas, NumPy, and other standard Python libraries

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sethanimesh/two-wheeler-loan-risk-assessment.git
   cd two-wheeler-loan-risk-assessment

2.	Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3.	Set up access to Google Vertex AI and Ollama Model (3.1) by configuring your API keys in the environment variables:
    export GOOGLE_VERTEX_AI_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"
    export OLLAMA_MODEL_API_KEY="your-ollama-api-key"

4.	Run the application:
    python app.py

Usage

Once the application is running, you can make POST requests to the backend API to assess the risk of loan applicants. You need to provide the following data:

	•	Demographic details (age, income, occupation, etc.)
	•	Bank transaction data for the last six months
	•	City-wise location details
	•	Results from the psychometric test

The system will return:

	•	A comprehensive risk score based on the multi-stage evaluation process.
	•	An analysis generated by the Ollama Model, offering insights into the risk assessment.

Future Enhancements

	•	Further fine-tuning the Ollama Model to improve the quality of analysis.
	•	Adding more granular data sources to enhance the location-based risk assessment.
	•	Expanding the psychometric test to include more behavioral factors for deeper analysis.

Conclusion

This risk assessment system revolutionizes the traditional loan approval process by integrating multiple data sources and leveraging advanced AI models. It reduces bias, provides a comprehensive understanding of the applicant’s risk, and improves the accuracy of loan decisions, particularly for underserved rural populations.
